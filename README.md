Empower her is a  full platform for a women's cooperative society.
There are three main user roles: managers, employees, and trainees, who can utilize the platform for networking, skill development, and entrepreneurship.
The project aims to empower women in the cooperative society by guiding them and giving them resources to succeed. 
Users can apply through forms to display their skills, helping managers match them with tasks and jobs efficiently.
Additionally, members can promote their business by showcasing their products on the platform's store and they can add, remove and edit the products in order for other users to buy. 
members also have a crucial role because they train and mentor users and this whole process is controlled by managers.
